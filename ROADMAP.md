- mongodb backend models

  - crud
  - sum (working)

- may need to simplify model (`type` column may not be needed as `value` ints in mongodb can be unsigned)

- date range search

- filter debit/credit (maybe by `value` >? 0 if i end up removing `type`)

- cli frontend?

- web frontend

- bank integration

- push notifications for getting close to limit

- periodical rollover
